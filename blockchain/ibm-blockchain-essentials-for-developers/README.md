In this course, you learn about some of the common challenges facing business networks and how a new approach to recording and processing transactions that uses blockchain technology can solve some of these challenges.

When you finish this course, you should understand:

Blockchain and distributed ledger systems in a business environment
Important concepts and key use cases of blockchain for business
How assets can be transferred in a blockchain network
The structure and benefits of using Hyperledger Composer, which is an open source project and a suite of high-level abstractions for business networks
How to use Hyperledger Composer to model and build a simple business network
The components and structure of Hyperledger Fabric, which is a blockchain framework that uses containers to host smart contracts called chaincode that comprise the application logic of the system
Blockchain solution components, such as wallets, ledgers, participants, consensus, security, and smart contracts
Key considerations and responsibilities of those who help to build, model, run, and maintain a blockchain business network: Developers and Administrators
Methods to arrive at consensus
Tools and applications that you can use to interact with the network


Labs
When you complete the labs in this course, you'll understand how to transfer assets, model, build, and programmatically interact with a blockchain network.

Lab 1: Use the web-hosted Hyperledger Playground Composer to transfer assets in a car auction network.
Lab 2: Model a simple network by using Hyperledger Composer that's installed on your local machine. (This lab only works on a Mac)
Lab 3: Build a simple application that queries and updates the ledger by using chaincode.
Lab 4: Build your own network.
